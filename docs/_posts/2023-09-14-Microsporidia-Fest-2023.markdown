For the last five years, and especially during the pandemic, I missed a platform to discuss about my current and past work in the field of microsporidia. It was therefore a great honor and pleasure to interact with some core people driving microsporidian research at the "Microsporidia Fest". The stimulating presentations inspired me to new project ideas and maybe future collaborations.  
  
The slides for my short presentation can be found [here](../slides/Microsporidia_Fest_230913.pdf). As always, don't hesitate contacting me for discussion or question.
