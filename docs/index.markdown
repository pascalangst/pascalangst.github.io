I am a Postdoc at the [University of Basel](https://evolution.unibas.ch/ebert/index.htm) in the Zoology Unit within the Department of Environmental Sciences. My research focuses on evolutionary biology and population genetics, employing simulation and empirical genomics.  

I received my PhD in the Department of Environmental Sciences, Zoology, at the University of Basel, working with Dieter Ebert and Peter D. Fields. My PhD focused on metapopulations, i.e., interconnected populations with extinction-(re)colonization dynamics. Specifically, I investigated the genomic consequences of metapopulation dynamics.  

My undergraduate research involved examining and disentangling the effects of population structure, demographic history, geophylogeny, transmission mode, and host-parasite interactions on the genomic diversity of microsporidia, obligate intracellular parasites phylogenetically associated with the fungi.
