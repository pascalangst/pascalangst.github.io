I am a PhD student in evolutionary biology at the [University of Basel]( https://evolution.unibas.ch/ebert/index.htm).  
  
My PhD is supervised by Dieter Ebert and co-supervised by Peter D. Fields, and I am affiliated with the Department of Environmental Sciences, Zoology.  
  
My research focusses on the evolution of metapopulations, i.e., interconnected populations with extinction-(re)colonization dynamics. Specifically, I am interested in the genomic consequences of metapopulation dynamics. 

My undergraduate research involved examining and disentangling the effects of population structure, demographic history, geophylogeny, transmission mode, and host-parasite interactions on the genomic diversity of microsporidia, obligate intracellular parasites phylogenetically associated with the fungi.
